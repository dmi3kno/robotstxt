\usage{
paths_allowed(paths = "/", domain = "auto", bot = "*",
  user_agent = utils::sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string,
  check_method = c("spiderbar"), warn = TRUE, force = FALSE,
  ssl_verifypeer = c(1, 0), use_futures = TRUE,
  robotstxt_list = NULL,
  rt_request_handler = robotstxt::rt_request_handler,
  rt_robotstxt_http_getter = robotstxt::get_robotstxt_http_get,
  rt_event_handler = robotstxt::default_event_handler)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{paths for which to check bot's permission, defaults to "/". Please, note that path to a folder should end with a trailing slash ("/").}

\item{domain}{Domain for which paths should be checked. Defaults to "auto".
If set to "auto" function will try to guess the domain by parsing the paths
argument. Note however, that these are educated guesses which might utterly
fail. To be on the save side, provide appropriate domains manually.}

\item{bot}{name of the bot, defaults to "*"}

\item{user_agent}{HTTP user-agent string to be used to retrieve robots.txt
file from domain}

\item{check_method}{at the moment only kept for backward compatibility reasons - do not use parameter anymore --> will let the function simply use the default}

\item{warn}{suppress warnings}

\item{force}{if TRUE instead of using possible cached results the function
will re-download the robotstxt file HTTP response status 404. If this
happens,}

\item{ssl_verifypeer}{analog to CURL option
\url{https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.html} -- and
might help with robots.txt file retrieval in some cases}

\item{use_futures}{Should future::future_lapply be used for possible
parallel/async retrieval or not. Note: check out help
pages and vignettes of package future on how to set up
plans for future execution because the robotstxt package
does not do it on its own.}

\item{robotstxt_list}{either NULL -- the default -- or a list of character
vectors with one vector per path to check}

\item{rt_request_handler}{handler function that handles request according to
the event handlers specified}

\item{rt_robotstxt_http_getter}{function that executes HTTP request}
}
